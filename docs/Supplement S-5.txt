SUPPLEMENT S5 — Great Expectations (Collapsed Speech Acts)

Source text:  Great Expectations
“Hold your noise!” cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from
among the graves at the side of the church porch. “Keep still, you
little devil, or I’ll cut your throat!”

A fearful man, all in coarse grey, with a great iron on his leg. A man
with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his
head. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and
lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by
briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose
teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin.

“Oh! Don’t cut my throat, sir,” I pleaded in terror. “Pray don’t do it,
sir.”

“Tell us your name!” said the man. “Quick!”

“Pip, sir.”

“Once more,” said the man, staring at me. “Give it mouth!”

“Pip. Pip, sir.”

“Show us where you live,” said the man. “Pint out the place!”

I pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the
alder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.

The man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and
emptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread.
When the church came to itself,—for he was so sudden and strong that he
made it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my
feet,—when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high
tombstone, trembling while he ate the bread ravenously.

S5.1 Event Segmentation (Collapsed Speech Acts)
This supplement documents the collapsedspeechact segmentation of the Great Expectations passage. Unlike the finegrained segmentation in Supplement S4, this version merges microutterances into coherent semantic units. The result is 14 events, reducing segmentation noise introduced by ultrashort speech acts.
Events:
1. Man starts up from among the graves
2. Man cries “Hold your noise!”
3. Man threatens to cut the child’s throat
4. Man is described as fearful, coarse grey, iron on leg, soaked and torn
5. Man seizes Pip by the chin
6. Pip pleads not to have his throat cut
7. Man demands Pip’s name (merged: initial demand + “Give it mouth!”)
8. Pip gives his name (merged: “Pip” + “Pip, sir.”)
9. Man orders Pip to show where he lives
10. Pip points to the village
11. Man turns Pip upside down and empties his pockets
12. Man finds only a piece of bread
13. The church “comes to itself” (motion from rough handling)
14. Pip sits trembling on a tombstone while the man eats the bread
This segmentation reduces the original 16 microevents (Supplement S4) to 14 coherent events, eliminating noise from ultrashort speech acts.

S5.2 Poset Cover Relations (Collapsed Speech Acts)
Cover relations (i, j) indicate that event i must precede event j in the narrative poset.
Compact poset:
{(1,2),(2,3),(3,5),(4,5),(5,6),(6,7),(7,8),(8,9),
 (9,10),(10,11),(11,12),(11,13),(12,14),(13,14)}

S5.3 Methods
Permutation Generation and Metrics
Using the collapsed eventization, we generated 5,000 random permutations and computed the structural metrics used throughout the paper:
* Kendall distance (dK)
* scaled ?weighted displacement (disp_kappa_scaled)
* adjacencycover violations
* singlemove distance
* maxblockmove distance
* orderdual proximity
* directional coherence (score_dir)
Embedding and Clustering
All permutations were embedded into the 8dimensional hybrid metric space (Section?3.1 of the main paper).
For visualization, we projected the embedding into 3D using PCA, but clustering was performed in the full 8D space.
We applied Kmeans with k = 6 to test whether additional cluster resolution would reveal finergrained structure.
Motif Assignment
Motifs were assigned using the deterministic structural rules in Section?3.2 of the main paper:
* BRE — BlockReorder Extremes
* APD — AnchorPreserving Disorder
* FM/EM — FrontMove / EndMove
* DCO — DualCluster Outliers
* GD — Global Distortion
* Other — heterogeneous residual class
Motif assignment is independent of clustering and depends solely on structural metrics.

S5.4 Results
Motif Cardinalities (TextOnly)
Other: 3366
GD: 1334
FM/EM: 177
BRE: 123
APD and DCO did not appear in this passage, consistent with its short, linear structure and lack of anchor or dualcluster affordances.
Exemplar Permutations
Representative permutations (top three by score_dir) for each motif are provided in:
cluster_examples_3percluster.csv
Clustering Structure
Clustering in the full 8D embedding produced six clusters, but motif assignments remained unchanged.
This demonstrates that motif taxonomy is robust to clustering resolution: structural thresholds dominate the organization of the permutation space.
Effect of SpeechAct Collapsing
Collapsing speech acts:
* reduces segmentation noise
* prevents artificial inflation of the GD motif (seen in Supplement S4)
* yields a more interpretable motif distribution
* aligns more closely with the Grimm analysis (Supplement S3)
The collapsed segmentation provides a clearer view of structural tendencies in the Great Expectations passage.
