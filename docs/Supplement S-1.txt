SUPPLEMENT S1 — Motif Stability, Artifacts, and Reproducibility

Overview
This Supplement documents the reproducibility artifacts, deterministic motif flags, and sensitivity analyses that accompany motif discovery described in Sections?2.5–2.6 of the main paper. It provides:
* orderinvariant multilabel flags for every permutation
* randomized stability diagnostics for the adjacencycover procedure
* bootstrap stability diagnostics for the structural metric
* adjudication templates for lowstability or overlapping cases
These materials enable independent inspection of motif assignments, targeted manual review of borderline exemplars, and transparent reconstruction of all diagnostic outputs.
To complement the stability analyses, this Supplement also describes the procedure used to identify permutations that are structurally distant yet geometrically close in the embedding, and it provides textonly listings of representative counterexamples.

Methods
Clustering and discovery
Clustering of the hybridmetric embedding was performed using PAM (k = 4) to identify macrofamilies and to select representative exemplars for descriptive summaries. Kruskal–Wallis tests were applied as nonparametric diagnostics to compare cluster distributions of structural metrics. No rulebased primary labels were used to discover clusters; all motif labels were applied post hoc using deterministic structural rules.

Deterministic motif rules and orderinvariant flags
Deterministic heuristics were applied to detect motif conditions within the invalid cloud, including:
* block moves
* longrange displacements
* anchor preservation
* proximity to the orderdual
For each permutation we record orderinvariant multilabel flags (a permutation may satisfy multiple motif conditions). For comparison and adjudication, we also record a precedencebased primary label using the sequence:
GlobalDistortion ? FrontEndMove ? BlockReorderExtreme ? DualClusterOutlier ? AnchorPreservingDisorder ? Other
Orderinvariant flags were defined by testing violations of the canonical adjacency covers extracted from the Ten Virgins parable:
(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (3,8), (4,8), (5,6), (6,7), (7,8), (8,9), (9,10), (10,11), (11,12)

Randomized stability tests
To quantify sensitivity to the adjacencycover order, we randomized the covercheck sequence and computed a stability_fraction for each permutation: the fraction of random orders that preserved the original sequential firstviolated cover.
* Default run: N = 500 random orders
* Extended runs: N = 2000
Separately, rank stability of the structural metric was assessed using bootstrap perturbations. Summary concordance statistics are included in this Supplement.

Adjudication workflow
Permutations flagged as ambiguous (multiple multilabel flags, low stability_fraction, or overlapping firstviolated covers) are exported for human adjudication. This Supplement includes:
* an adjudication rubric
* an adjudication log template
* CSVs of adjudication candidates
These materials document final decisions and rationale.

Counterexample identification: structurally distant but geometrically close permutations
This Supplement documents the procedure used to identify permutations that are structurally distant (large ?weighted displacement) yet geometrically proximate (high score_dir) in the embedding.
These counterexamples illustrate that geometric proximity does not guarantee structural similarity, and they clarify why motif assignment is based entirely on structural features rather than embedding coordinates.

Procedure
1. Load the full ?dispersion dataset (~479,000 rows).
2. Compute joint extremality: 
o rank permutations by disp_kappa_scaled (descending)
o rank permutations by score_dir (descending)
3. Identify candidates in the top decile of both structural displacement and geometric similarity.
4. Filter out trivial duals and nearduals (expected to be structurally extreme but geometrically coherent).
5. Inspect remaining candidates for adjacencycover patterns, motifrule violations, and embedding coordinates.
6. Export textonly counterexample lines for inclusion in this Supplement and for reproducibility.

Representative counterexamples (textonly)
These permutations satisfy the joint extremality criterion:
[8, 6, 11, 12, 7, 2, 9, 4, 10, 1, 5, 3], score_dir = 0.6762, disp_kappa_scaled = 884.7481
[9, 10, 7, 11, 1, 12, 6, 4, 3, 5, 2, 8], score_dir = 0.6766, disp_kappa_scaled = 944.8404
[5, 12, 9, 11, 8, 10, 4, 3, 7, 2, 1, 6], score_dir = 0.6650, disp_kappa_scaled = 1055.7419
[11, 12, 10, 2, 9, 3, 5, 8, 4, 6, 7, 1], score_dir = 0.6802, disp_kappa_scaled = 841.0187
[8, 6, 5, 12, 1, 11, 2, 3, 9, 10, 7, 4], score_dir = 0.7144, disp_kappa_scaled = 469.0068
These cases demonstrate that the structural metric can assign large displacement to permutations that remain geometrically close in the embedding.

Key stability results (summary)
Structural metric rank stability (bootstrap)
Mean rank concordance for the demonstration run: 0.981 (N = 500).
Diagnostic distributions and exemplar minima identify borderline cases for manual review.
Coverorder sensitivity
The stability_fraction quantifies how often the original sequential firstviolated cover is preserved under randomized cover checks.
Lowstability rows are exported for adjudication.

Provenance and reproducibility notes
All artifacts in this Supplement were produced from the pipeline outputs and demonstration reader summary included with the Supplement.
If real reader data are substituted, rerun the scripts in scripts/ to regenerate final artifacts and updated stability summaries.
Both orderinvariant multilabel outputs and precedencebased primary labels are archived so readers can reproduce both approaches and inspect cases where they diverge.
