Narrative setup: Ten maidens took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
Contrast statement: Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.
Possession contrast: For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them; but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps.
Delay and sleep: As the bridegroom was delayed, they all slumbered and slept.
Alarm event: But at midnight there was a cry: “Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.”
Preparation reaction: Then all those maidens rose and trimmed their lamps.
Request and plea: And the foolish said to the wise, “Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.”
Refusal and advice: But the wise replied, “Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you; go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.”
Outcome and exclusion: And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.
Aftermath and denial: Afterward the other maidens came also, saying, “Lord, lord, open to us.” But he replied, "Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.”
